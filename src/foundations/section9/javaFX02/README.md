# Exercise 3
• Edit your current `JavaFX` project.
- We’re going to do a little experimenting.

• After adding a button to the Root Node, try to change its position.
- `btn1.setLayoutY(100)`;

• Will a button’s position change if the Root Node wasn't a StackPane? Try these alternatives:
- `TilePane`
- `VBox`
- `Group`
