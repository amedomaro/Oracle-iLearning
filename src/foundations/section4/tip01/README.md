# Exercise 1
## Let’s look at a scenario and see how we can model the components involved:
–It’s Alex’s birthday! You’ve arranged a group of eight friends to celebrate at a local 
restaurant. When your party receives their bill, nobody is quite sure what they owe. 
You only know everyone’s total before tax (5%) and tip (15%). But lucky you!  You brought 
your laptop and are asked to write a program that calculates everybody’s total.

• Import and edit the Tip01 project.

• This is what everyone owes before tax (5%) and tip (15%):

-------------------------------------------------
| Person 1: 10$         | Person 5: 7$          |
-------------------------------------------------
| Person 2: 12$         | Person 6: 15$ (Alex)  |
-------------------------------------------------
| Person 3: 9$          | Person 7: 11$         |
-------------------------------------------------
| Person 4: 8$          | Person 8: 30$         |

Your program should produce the following output:
~~~~
person1: $12.0
person2: $14.4
person3: $10.8
person4: $9.6
person5: $8.4
person6: $18.0
