# Exercise 3
• Import and open the `Tip03` project.

• From the main method:

– Use a `Calculator` object instance and supply arguments to `findTotal()` to print the total 
for each person.

– Hint: Observe the `findTotal()` method in the `Calculator` class to figure out how many 
arguments this method accepts.

• Who does each total belong to?

• Modify the `findTotal()` method to accept an additional 
`String name` argument.

• Concatenate the print statement to include `name`.

• Observe NetBeans’ complaint in the main method and revise your `findTotal()` method 
calls.
