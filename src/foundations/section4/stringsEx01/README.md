# Exercise 1
• Import and open the `StringsEx` project.

• Examine `ShoppingCart.java`.

– Perform the following:

– Use the `indexOf` method to get the index for the space character (" ") within `custName`. 
Assign it to `spaceIdx`.

– Use the substring method and `spaceIdx` to get the first name portion of `custName`. 
Assign it to `firstName` and print `firstName`.

• You might notice that this project has two `.java` files with main methods.

– This could seem like a contradiction because we said never to write more than one main 
method!

• Sometimes programmers do this when they're testing small bits of code and they want to 
keep all their files neatly in one project.

– Unfortunately, pressing run in NetBeans always runs the same file and never the others.

– You'll have to right-click the alternate file you want to run. A menu will appear with 
an option to run that file.
