# Exercise 1
• Import and open the `WhileLoopEx` project.

• Modify `SquareRootWhile.jav`a to use a while loop to repeatedly prompt users to type a number until they 
type a non-negative number, and then computes the square root.

Expected output:
~~~~
Type a non-negative integer: -5
Invalid number, try again: -1
Invalid number, try again: 11
The square root of 11 is 3.166
