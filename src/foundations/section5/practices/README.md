# Practices - Section 5
### Problem 1: Determining color in the visible spectrum 
###### Overview
Write an interactive Java program, `ColorRange.java`, which when given a wavelength in nanometers will return 
the corresponding color in the visible spectrum.

|         Color         |     Wavelength (nm)   |
-------------------------------------------------
|         Violet        |        380-450        |
-------------------------------------------------
|         Blue          |        450-495        |
-------------------------------------------------
|         Green         |        495-570        |
-------------------------------------------------
|         Yellow        |        570-590        |
-------------------------------------------------
|         Orange        |        590-620        |
-------------------------------------------------
|         Red           |        620-750        |

###### Task
You must implement the following using a suitable `if` decision statement.
1. Prompt the user to enter the wavelength, the wavelength should be of type `double`.
2. For each range (e.g. 380-450) the number on the left is included in the range, but the number on the right 
is not included in the range.
3. If the input value is not found on the visible spectrum then state that the wavelength is not within the 
visible spectrum.
4. Expected Output:
~~~~
a. Enter a color code 630 The color is Red 
b. Enter a color code 25.0 The entered wavelength is not a part of the visible spectrum 
c. Enter a color code 750.5 The entered wavelength is not a part of the visible spectrum

### Problem 2: Determining the next color for a stop light 
###### Overview
The normal behavior for a stop light is to cycle from Red to Green to Yellow to Red (and continues with this 
pattern). Write a java program `StopLight.java`, which will determine the next color of a stop light in this 
pattern, Red to Green to Yellow to Red based on the current stop light provided by the user.

###### Task
You must implement the following using a suitable `if` decision statement.
1.  Have the user enter the value for the `currentColor`.
2. Compute the next color stop light based on the `currentColor`.
3.  Alert the user for any invalid value of color.
~~~~
Expected Output:
a. Enter a color code
    1
       Next Traffic Light is green 
b. Enter a color code
    3
       Next Traffic Light is red 
c. Enter a color code
    0
       Invalid color 
d. Enter a color code
    4
       Invalid color

### Problem 3: Determining the next color for a stop light using `switch`
###### Overview
Re-write practice 2 using `switch` statement.

###### Task
Implement practice 2 using `switch` statement and ensure the program alert users if theyâ€™ve entered anyinvalid value.
