# Exercise 5 
• Import and open the `IfElseEx` project.

• Examine `StringEquality.java`.

• Use an `if` and an `if/else` statement: 

– Declare a `String` variable name.

– Have the user input a value for the name.

– Check whether the name is “Moe,” and then print “You are the king of rock and roll.”

– Otherwise print “You are not the king.”

– Don’t use ==.
