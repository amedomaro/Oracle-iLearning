# Exercise 3 
• Import and open the `IfElseEx` project.

• Examine AgeCheck.java:

– The program has a logic problem. 

– For some values, it prints the wrong answer. 

– Find the problems and fix them. (You may need to run the program a few times and 
try different values to see which ones fail.)

– Replace the two `if` statements with an `if/else` statement.
