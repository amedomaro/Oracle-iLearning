# Exercise 3 
• Import and open the `ConditionalEx` project.

• Examine `ComputeFare.java`.

• Implement the following using `if/else` constructs:
~~~~
– Declare an integer variable, age.
– Have the user enter the value for age.
~~~~
• Using a chained if construct, compute the fare based on  the age according to these 
conditions:
~~~~
– If age is less than 11, then fare=3$.
– If age is greater than 11 and less than 65, then fare=5$.
– Else for all other ages, then fare = 3$.
