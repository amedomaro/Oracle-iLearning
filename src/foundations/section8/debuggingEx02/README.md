# Exercise 2
### Scenario
• Let’s assume you have a car, and you want to go to the gas station. You have the following details:
- Car’s current position: x1 and y1
- Gas station’s location: x2 and y2
- Speed of the car•You want to compute the time it will take for the car from its current position 
(x1,y1) to reach the gas station (x2,y2).

• A Java program to compute the time by using the `time=distance/speed` formula is available in the 
`ComputeTime` project.

### The task
• Import and open the `DebuggingEx` project.

• Observe `ComputeTime.java`.

• Run the program with the NetBeans debugger to debug this program: 
- Set the breakpoint in the `getDistance` method.
- Press StepInto go to the next line.
- Observe the values of the `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, `speed`, `distance`, and `time` variables.

• Can you identify the bug?
