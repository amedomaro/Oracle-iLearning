# Exercise 3
• Continue editing the `AccountTest` project.

• Write a `withdraw()` method for checking accounts that ...

– Accepts a double argument for the amount to be withdrawn.

– Prints a warning if the balance is too low to make the withdrawal.

– Prints a warning if the withdrawal argument is negative.

– If there are no warnings, the withdrawal amount is subtracted from the balance. Print the new balance.

• Test this method with the instance from Exercise 2.
