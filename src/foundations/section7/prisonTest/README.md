# Exercise 2
• Continue editing the `PrisonTest` project.

• Modify the `Prisoner` class:

–Include a static integer `prisonerCount` field. This field counts the total number of prisoners 
instantiated. Initialize this field to 0. Increase this field every time a prisoner is instantiated.

– Include an integer `bookingNumber` field. This field is initialized with the current value of 
prisonerCount.

– Print the `bookingNumber` and `prisonerCount` as part of the `display()` method.

• Instantiate a few prisoners and display their info.
