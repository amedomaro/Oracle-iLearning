# Exercise 1
### Part 1
• Create a new Java project.

• Create a `PrisonTest` class with a main method.

• Create a `Prisoner` class based on the description in the previous slide.

• Instantiate two prisoners and assign them the following properties:
~~~~
Name:      Bubba
Height:    2.08
Sentence:  4 years

Name:      Twitch
Height:    1.73m
Sentence:  3 years
~~~~
### Part 2
• Can prisoners fool security by impersonating each other?

• Write a print statement with a boolean expression that tests if `bubba == twitch`.

• Change the properties of `twitch` so that they match `bubba`.

• Then test the equality of these objects again.
