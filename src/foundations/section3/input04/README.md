# Exercise 4
• Import and edit the Input04 project.

• Run the code and examine the output.

• Read through each next line until you find `"BlueBumper"`.

• The two numbers following `"BlueBumper"` are the object’s `xPositon` and `yPosition`. 
Store these coordinates as integers and print them.

• Examine `input04text.txt`, if necessary.

Examine `Level05.txt` if you’re curious:

–This is how level data is stored for Java Puzzle Ball.

–Reading and parsing level data is slightly more complicated than what you’ve done in this exercise.

–But if you finished this exercise, you’re close to understanding how it’s done.
